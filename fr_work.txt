### **How the Frontend Should Work**  

Your **Next.js frontend** will interact with the **Django backend** using REST APIs. The frontend will be responsible for user authentication, dashboard views based on roles, and handling data from the backend.

---

## **1. Authentication & Role-Based Access**  
- **User Login & Registration**  
  - A user logs in via email & password.  
  - The backend sends a JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookies.  
  - The frontend checks the user role (`Admin`, `Mentor`, `Mentee`) and redirects them accordingly.  
  - Users stay logged in using session-based authentication.

- **Protected Routes**  
  - The frontend will have protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/meetings`, etc.), restricting access based on user roles.  
  - If a user is not authenticated, they are redirected to `/login`.

---

## **2. Admin Panel**  
- **User Management**  
  - View all users (Admins, Mentors, Mentees).  
  - Create, edit, delete user accounts.  
  - Assign mentees to mentors.

- **System Logs & Reports**  
  - View logs of communications, meeting records, and activity tracking.  
  - Generate reports on mentee progress.

- **Announcements & Alerts**  
  - Send system-wide announcements to all users.  
  - Send emergency alerts to specific users.

---

## **3. Mentor Dashboard**  
- **Manage Assigned Mentees**  
  - View a list of assigned mentees with their progress.  
  - View mentee profiles, grades, attendance, and achievements.  

- **Meeting Management**  
  - Schedule, reschedule, or cancel meetings.  
  - View meeting history and upcoming schedules.  
  - Send automated reminders before meetings.

- **Communication**  
  - Send messages to assigned mentees.  
  - Receive messages from mentees.  
  - Receive notifications for important updates.

- **Achievements & Feedback**  
  - Award badges and certificates to mentees.  
  - Provide feedback on assignments and progress.

---

## **4. Mentee Dashboard**  
- **Track Progress**  
  - View personal grades, attendance, and achievements.  
  - Check received badges and certificates.

- **Meeting Requests & Calendar**  
  - Request a meeting with a mentor.  
  - View scheduled meetings with details (date, time, mode: online/offline).  
  - Receive reminders for upcoming meetings.

- **Communication**  
  - Send messages to assigned mentors.  
  - Receive feedback on progress and assignments.

- **File Uploads**  
  - Upload assignments, project reports, and other relevant files.  
  - View submitted work history.

---

## **5. Communication System**  
- **One-to-One Messaging**  
  - Real-time messaging between mentors and mentees.  
  - Notifications for new messages.

- **Broadcast Announcements**  
  - Mentors can send announcements to all mentees.  
  - Admins can send announcements to all users.

- **Emergency Alerts**  
  - Admins can send urgent notifications to specific users.

---

## **6. Integration with Backend (API Calls)**  
- Use **Axios** to fetch data from Django backend APIs.  
- Store authentication tokens in **HTTP-only cookies**.  
- Use **React Query or SWR** for efficient data fetching.

## **How the Frontend Should Function Step-by-Step**  
1. **User logs in** â†’ Redirects to their respective dashboard.  
2. **Mentor Dashboard** â†’ Lists assigned mentees, meetings, and progress tracking.  
3. **Mentee Dashboard** â†’ Shows personal progress, meeting requests, and mentor communication.  
4. **Admin Panel** â†’ Manages users, logs, reports, and system settings.  
5. **Meetings & Communication** â†’ Scheduling, messaging, and reminders are handled dynamically.  
6. **Role-Based Access** â†’ Unauthorized users cannot access restricted pages.  

This ensures a **smooth user experience** with real-time updates and secure data handling. Let me know if you need specific implementation details! ðŸš€
